## Explanations

### 1. Increase funding and improve quality of schools.

```{r table function}
table_func <- function(df) {
  temp <- df %>% group_by(page_actual) %>% count() %>% 
    rename(Page = page_actual,
           Mentions = n) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    add_row(Page = "Total", Mentions = nrow(df)) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(position = "center", 
                  latex_options = "hold_position")
  return(temp)
}
```

```{r school tabular}
# # table_func(school_text2)
```
