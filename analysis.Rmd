## Explanations

### 1. Increase funding and improve quality of schools.

```{r table function}
table_func <- function(df) {
  temp <- df %>% group_by(page) %>% count() %>% 
    rename(Page = page,
           Mentions = n) %>% 
    ungroup() %>% 
    add_row(Page = "Total", Mentions = nrow(df)) %>% 
    kable() %>% 
    kable_styling(position = "center", 
                  latex_options = "hold_position")
  return(temp)
}
```

```{r school tabular}
table_func(school_text2)
```

- Increasing budget of public education: `r nrow(funding_text)`

- Increasing quality of public education: `r nrow(squality_text)`

- Alternatives to public schools: `r nrow(altschool_text) + 1`

  - Increase City/County support for magnet, private, and charter schools: 9
  
  - Decrease funding for charter schools and increase public school: 9
  
### 2. Subsidizing, fully-funding, or increasing access to pre-kindergarten, childcare, and early education.
  
```{r prek tabular}
table_func(prek_text)
```

```{r subset prek}
prek_only <- c("prek", "pre-k", "pre k", "preschool", "pre?k")
childcare <- c("childcare", "early childhood", "childhood development", "daycare")
```

- Public/subsidized/universal pre-k: `r nrow(filter_func(prek_text, prek_only))`

- More public childcare and support for early development: `r nrow(filter_func(prek_text, childcare))`

### 3. Increasing public school teacher salaries and attracting/retaining higher quality instructors.

```{r teachers tabular}
table_func(teacher_text)
```

- Improve teacher pay: `r nrow(pay_text)`

- Improve teacher quality: `r nrow(quality_text)`

- Incentives to retain teachers: 8

### 4. Addressing violence, gangs, and relationships with police.

```{r safety tabular}
table_func(safety_text)
```

```{r safety subset}
spaces <- c("space", "place")

police <- c("police", "cop", "officer", "sro")
```

- Addressing gang violence: `r nrow(safety_text %>% filter(str_detect(response, "gang")))`

- Safety in schools: 6
  - COVID-19 in schools: 1
  - Remove police from schools: 2
  - Increase police presence in schools: 1
  - Safety in schools: 2
  
- Police: 7
  - Source police in their own neighborhoods: 1
  - Fund alternatives to policing like social workers: 4
  - Improve quality of police: 2

- Creating safer spaces for youth: `r nrow(filter_func(safety_text, spaces))`

### 5. Increasing and improving after school programs and recreational spaces for youth.

**Total: `r nrow(afterschool_text)`**

```{r afterschool tabular}
table_func(afterschool_text)
```

- Parks and playgrounds: `r nrow(parks_text) - 2`
  - Improving the quality and safety of parks and playgrounds: 7
  - Improving access and number of parks and greenspaces: 7
  
- More recreational opportunities for youth: `r nrow(recreation_text) - 5`

- After school activities: `r nrow(afterschool_text)`

### 6. Increasing opportunities for youth employment, internships, mentorship, and job training.

```{r employment tabular}
table_func(employment_text)
```
```{r employment subset}
temp <- c("intern", "apprentice", "training")
```

- More paid employment opportunities: 

- Internships, apprenticeships, and job training: `r nrow(filter_func(employment_text, temp))`

- Increase number of mentor relationships: `r nrow(mentor_text)`

### 7. Increasing funding for services that address food insecurity, poverty, and other social inequalities.

```{r foodpoverty tabular}
table_func(services_text)
```

- Increasing funding for general social services or increasing the number of social workers: `r nrow(gservices_text)`

  - Providing free breakfasts or lunches to youth in schools: 6

- Addressing housing insecurity: `r nrow(housing_text)`

  - Increasing affordable housing: 9
  
  - Improving housing conditions: 2
  
  - Less development in downtown Durham: 1

- Creating higher quality and safer public transportation for youth, particularly to school and to after school activities: `r nrow(transit_text)`

- Increasing access to mental health services for youth and their parents: `r nrow(mentalhealth_text)`

- Providing technology to families and youth: `r nrow(tech_text)`
