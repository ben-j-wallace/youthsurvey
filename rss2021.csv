That training and certification could afford them the opportunity to be homeowners, earn a decent salary, become a businessperson, and become a productive citizen instead of a gang banger.

I believe I've read that DPS receives the second-highest level of funding per student in the state.  The outcomes don't reflect that. Stop the misguided downtown development. I don't need a Google office there.  Put it in the park. Durham's policy has exacerbated a housing crunch that may have been there anyway while losing out on economic development.

This year. Better—but really, it’s just OnDemand home schooling.",50,city
"Young children need a strong male & female model of good character as they grow & mature. Children might meet their potential if the city & county encouraged “family” events, supported Big Brother type of organizations, & supported unwed mothers not only with money but teaching them skills. Much research suggests that even 1 good person who models good behaviors can make a difference in a child’s life & help break the bad cycle from which the child comes. I know this research to be true from witnessing lives of people I know. They are people who broke out of the bad cycle & are now contributing members of society.",50,city
