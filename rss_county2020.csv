That training and certification could afford them the opportunity to be homeowners, earn a decent salary, become a businessperson, and become a productive citizen instead of a gang banger.

"Conduct support groups for ages 10 to 15 years old and find out their concerns, what they think, what they feel for them and for themselves in order to help them be more focused on their decisions and not make mistakes at an early age so that learn to take care of themselves and their community and respect the people around them who are cautious...in reality, youth need a lot of help for a better tomorrow...helping youth is the best thing that can be done do for a better life in the future... to care for and grow what is already there in the present....thank you...",13

I would like to see more housing neighborhoods & quality construction in the 100K price range. Durham has a lot of high end and low end and not much in the middle.",15
"The magnet school system is a great start. Decent housing for all kids is so important??functional housing away from crime areas and safe transit to schools. After?school programs for kids whose parents must work. Safe places for kids to be when their guardians aren't around.  Alternative outlets for youth angst and energy (alternative to gangs.)  Not de?fund the police but add a ""social worker"" component.",15
"There  are  huge  socio?economic  disparities  existing  in  Durham  right  now,  and  gentrification  is pushing marginalized people out. We need to start with affordable housing that is pleasant. Then fix  school  facilities  and  ensure  enough  bus  drivers,  teachers,  cafeteria  workers.  Then  provide programming to teach skills and pull people out of poverty.",15
"To be safe, listen to the world and do the best they can and do your best.",15
Treat all the same.,15
"Try improving the quality of management in schools. Even if individual teachers are very good, continuity and consistency are lacking.  I believe I've read that DPS receives the second?highest level of funding per student in the state.  The outcomes don't reflect that. Stop the misguided downtown development. I don't need a Google office there.  Put it in the park. Durham's policy has exacerbated a housing crunch that may have been there anyway while losing out on economic development. You can call yourselves """"progressive"""" but having kids shot near my house, failing schools, and a lack of affordable housing isn't the kind of progress I want.",15

"You can’t just have a few stand out teachers or schools and clap for yourself.  You have to have a good school system. The grades speak for themselves. These kids are undereducated in every category. I would move to a shack in Chapel Hill before I would live in a mansion in Durham and send  my  kid  to  public  school  in  Durham.  I  tried  Ignite!  This  year.  Better—but  really,  it’s  just OnDemand home schooling.",16
"Young children need a strong male & female model of good character as they grow & mature. Children might meet their potential if the city & county encouraged “family” events, supported Big Brother type of organizations, & supported unwed mothers not only with money but teaching them skills. Much research suggests that even 1 good person who models good behaviors can make a difference in a child’s life & help break the bad cycle from which the child comes. I know this research to be true from witnessing lives of people I know. They are people who broke out of the bad cycle & are now contributing members of society.",16

Youth need a center for activities.,16
